                <h1>DONOR OF THE WEEK</h1>
              <p><b>WHY IS DONATING FOOD IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY?</b></p>
              <p> 1) There are many things we like to think we can’t go without, like luxury items and the latest technology.
                  Then there are things that we absolutely need but often take for granted.  One of those things is the three 
                  square meals we have each morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>
              
              <p>2) Donating food we don’t need to the less fortunate benefits in the overall well-being of our communities in more
                 ways than we may realize.</p>  
              
               <p>3) Reduce Environmental Impact</p> 
               <p>4) Donating food actually helps serve two purposes for bettering communities, though one is less obvious than the
                 other.  Aside from the immediate benefits to the members of our communities the planet benefits greatly as well.  
                 The less unspoiled food that gets thrown away, the less unspoiled food that is sent to a landfill where it 
                 ultimately goes to waste. </p> 
                <p> 5) Community Members Thrive
                  When people are able to eat, they’re healthy enough to play their part as active and engaged members of their 
                  communities.  This not only supports local communities and economies, but society on a larger scale.
                  </p>
               <p>
                6) Children and teenages are healthy enough to attend school where they learn both academics and social skills</p>
              <p> 7) Children and teenagers can grow properly when not experiencing malnutrition</p>
               <p>8) Adults have the health and energy needed to go to work and pay bills, afford necessities, and support their 
                families</br></p>
                <p>9) Seniors get the nutrition they need to stay healthy as they get older</br></p>
                <p>10) Chronically ill and disabled people are able to get the additional nutrients they require and have dietary 
                    restrictions met without sacrificing their overall well-being</p></p>
                
              
              <b>Lead By Example</b>
              <br>
              <p>Donating food isn’t hard.  There are many food banks and food pantries that will happily take your donations.
                  Unfortunately it isn’t something people consider as often as they should.  When you start volunteering in Bucks 
                  County, PA, you have a meaningful experience that you can communicate to others.  Hearing your story and your
                   efforts to help will inspire them to do the same.</p>
